The gif above shows a video file where the peak volume is -7.9dB, and after normalization it's raised to -1.1dB peak volume.

Usage:
  1. Press the _Select video file_ button.
  2. Press the _Analyze_ button to get the current values.
  3. Press _Normalize Audio_ to normalize the audio. If the file already exists nothing will happen.

## About

This is a desktop application that wraps [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) commands that I use from time to time.

To run this application, the `ffmpeg` binary needs to be available in _PATH_

Features:
  - Get the max and mean volume levels in dB
  - Normalize/raise volume of the audio on a video file

Goals:
  - Replace the audio track of a video with another audio file
  - Configurable path to ffmpeg binary

## Development

As of this writing it's built and run with
  - Go 1.19
  - ffmpeg 5.1
  - Wails 2.1.0


live development mode:

```sh
wails dev
```

there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115.

## Build
